# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Fantasy intel tools, all read-only: `get_player_trends` (weekly usage shares and trend labels), `get_team_usage` (an offense's volume split, vacated volume and who absorbs it), `get_injury_report` (ESPN designations merged with Sleeper's), `get_player_news` (ESPN player updates), `get_waiver_targets` (start_now, stash, ir_stash, drop_candidates and bench_watch with 3-week projections, horizons and reasons) and `get_lineup_report` (`get_lineup_projections`' output plus status, 72-hour news, usage and flags per starter and top bench player). Status and news carry `source` and `as_of`, and fall back to Sleeper when ESPN is unavailable.
- `gameday_check` prompt; `weekly_briefing` and `waiver_wire_report` now use the intel tools.
- 2025 waiver backtest (`scripts/backtest/`, `docs/BACKTEST.md`). The stash rule it favored (rank by 3-week projection, at most 5) is the default.
- Optional Sleeper session (`SLEEPER_TOKEN`, or `SLEEPER_EMAIL` + `SLEEPER_PASSWORD`) backed by Sleeper's private GraphQL API, with 2 private reads (`get_auth_status`, `get_pending_transactions`) and 9 write tools: `set_lineup`, `update_ir`, `update_taxi`, `add_drop_player`, `submit_waiver_claim`, `cancel_waiver_claim`, `propose_trade`, `respond_to_trade`, `post_league_message`. Every write validates locally (slot eligibility, IR/taxi limits, roster ownership, FAAB budget), supports `dry_run`, and returns the refreshed roster/transaction. `--read-only` / `SLEEPER_MCP_READ_ONLY` keeps writes off; the health endpoint reports `sleeper_session` and `writes_enabled`.
- Optional default user via `--user <name>` / `SLEEPER_USERNAME`, so "my team" and "my leagues" questions work without naming yourself ([#1](https://github.com/joscaz/sleeper-mcp/pull/1)).
- Open-source project files: contributing guide, code of conduct, security policy, issue and PR templates, Dependabot, and a tag-triggered release workflow.
- Write tools (`set_lineup`, `update_ir`, `update_taxi`, `add_drop_player`, `submit_waiver_claim`, `propose_trade`) read your roster from Sleeper's live store before planning a change. The public API trails a write by a minute or two, so a player added seconds earlier was "not on this roster" to `set_lineup`.
- Team selectors accept `team`: a username, display name or (partial) team name in one field. A caller that guessed `team` used to be silently answered with the default user's roster.
- `get_pending_transactions` searches the current and previous week by default: Sleeper keeps open claims and trade offers filed under the week they were created in, so right after the weekly rollover the queued claims were invisible.
- HTTP mode refuses to start when a Sleeper session with write tools enabled would listen on a non-loopback address without `SLEEPER_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`. `SLEEPER_MCP_INSECURE_NO_AUTH=1` overrides for deployments that authenticate in front of the server.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-11

- stdio and stateless Streamable HTTP transports, optional bearer auth, health check and CORS.
