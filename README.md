A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for [Sleeper](https://sleeper.com) fantasy football, built so an AI assistant can actually answer fantasy questions instead of handing you a wall of player IDs.

Ask Claude, Cursor, or any MCP client things like:

- "Who should I start this week in my dynasty league?"
- "Show me the standings and who's on the waiver wire at RB."
- "Was the Bijan-for-Chase trade fair? Who won it?"
- "Who did I draft in round 1 the last three years?"
- "Move Jacobs to IR, start Corum, and put a claim in for Kaelon Black." *(with a Sleeper session, see [Account tools](#account-tools-optional-session))*

No login, no API key for reads: Sleeper's public API covers everything above the "Account" line. Add your Sleeper session and the same server can also set lineups, manage IR/taxi, submit waiver claims and propose trades.

## Why another Sleeper MCP?

There are several community Sleeper MCP servers. This one focuses on the things that make the difference between "it works" and "it's useful in a conversation":

| | sleeper-mcp (this) | typical alternatives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Player IDs resolved to names/positions/teams/injury flags in every response | ✅ everywhere (rosters, matchups, transactions, drafts, brackets) | usually raw IDs, or names only in one or two tools |
| Roster IDs resolved to team + manager names | ✅ | rarely |
| Computed standings (rank, record, PF/PA, streak, FAAB left, divisions) | ✅ | raw roster settings |
| Matchups paired with per-player points and margins | ✅ | raw matchup arrays |
| Trades summarized as "gave / got" per side, picks and FAAB included | ✅ | raw adds/drops maps |
| Free agents for a league (unrostered, ranked, trending-annotated) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Projections & stats scored with the **league's exact scoring settings** | ✅ | ❌ (or PPR only) |
| Start/sit: optimal lineup with slot eligibility (FLEX, SUPER_FLEX, IDP) | ✅ | ❌ |
| League history across seasons with champions | ✅ | ❌ |
| Select a team by username, user_id, roster_id **or team name** | ✅ | user_id / roster_id only |
| "Current week/season" defaults from Sleeper's NFL state | ✅ | manual |
| Transports | stdio **and** Streamable HTTP (stateless, bearer auth, CORS, health check, Docker) | stdio only |
| Player database (~5 MB) | memory + disk cache, daily refresh, stale-cache fallback | re-downloaded per process |
| Rate limiting / retries | 600 req/min budget, backoff on 429/5xx, in-flight de-dup | none |
| Tests | 60+ unit + integration tests (in-memory and HTTP transports) plus a live smoke test | varies |
| Tool annotations, `structuredContent`, prompts, resources | ✅ | partial |

All 22 tools are read-only. Nothing here can change a lineup or make a trade.

## Quick start

Requires Node.js 20+.

### From source (today)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joscaz/sleeper-mcp.git
cd sleeper-mcp
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js --help
```

Then point your MCP client at `node /absolute/path/to/sleeper-mcp/dist/index.js`.

### From npm (once published)

```bash
npx -y @joscaz/sleeper-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop

`claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sleeper": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/sleeper-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": { "SLEEPER_USERNAME": "your_sleeper_username" }
    }
  }
}
```

(or `"command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@joscaz/sleeper-mcp"]` after publishing.)

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add sleeper -e SLEEPER_USERNAME=your_sleeper_username -- node /absolute/path/to/sleeper-mcp/dist/index.js
```

### Cursor / Windsurf / other stdio clients

Same shape: command `node`, args `["/absolute/path/to/sleeper-mcp/dist/index.js"]`, env `SLEEPER_USERNAME`.

### Make it yours

Sleeper's API is public and read-only, so there is no login step: every league, roster and matchup is readable by anyone who knows a username or league ID. The only thing the server cannot know by itself is *who you are*. Set `SLEEPER_USERNAME` (or pass `--user`) and every tool that takes a user or team falls back to you, so "what are my leagues?", "show my roster" and "who should I start?" work without naming yourself. Explicit selectors always win, so questions about other managers still work.

### Remote / hosted (Streamable HTTP)

```bash
SLEEPER_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=change-me node dist/index.js --http --port 3000
# MCP endpoint:  http://localhost:3000/mcp   (POST, JSON-RPC)
# Health check:  http://localhost:3000/healthz
```

Clients connect with the URL `http://host:3000/mcp` and, if a token is set, the header `Authorization: Bearer change-me`. When a Sleeper session is configured with write tools enabled, the token is mandatory unless the server is bound to loopback (`--host 127.0.0.1`): anyone who can reach an unauthenticated `/mcp` could otherwise change your lineups, drop players and send trades. The server refuses to start in that configuration. This works for Replit, Claude's remote MCP connectors, and anything else that speaks Streamable HTTP. The server is stateless (no sessions), so it can sit behind a load balancer or run on serverless platforms.

```bash
docker build -t sleeper-mcp .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e SLEEPER_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=change-me -v sleeper-cache:/data sleeper-mcp
```

## Tools

Every tool that takes a team accepts any of `username` (or display name), `user_id`, `roster_id`, `team_name` (partial, case-insensitive), `team` (any of those names in one field, when you are not sure which kind you have), or nothing at all when `SLEEPER_USERNAME` is set. `week` defaults to the current NFL week and `season` to the current league season.

### Users & leagues

| Tool | What it returns |
| --- | --- |
| `get_nfl_state` | Current season, `season_type`, week, `league_season`. |
| `get_user` | Username ↔ `user_id`, display name, avatar. |
| `get_user_leagues` | A user's leagues for a season with league_id, scoring format, roster shape, status. |
| `get_league` | Summarized settings: scoring (PPR/half/std, TE premium, pass TD, bonuses), roster slots, redraft/keeper/dynasty, waivers/FAAB, playoffs, trade deadline, divisions, commissioners. `include_raw` for the full objects. |
| `get_league_standings` | Ranked standings with record, PF/PA, streak, waiver position, FAAB remaining, division. Doubles as the roster_id → manager map. |
| `get_league_history` | Walks `previous_league_id` back through seasons: champion, runner-up, regular-season leader, points leader. |

### Rosters & matchups

| Tool | What it returns |
| --- | --- |
| `get_roster` | One team: starters labeled with slots (QB, RB, FLEX…), bench, IR, taxi, record, FAAB. |
| `get_league_rosters` | Every roster in the league (`include_bench=false` for a lighter payload). |
| `get_matchups` | Paired matchups for a week with scores, margin, leader, starters with per-player points (`include_bench` for bench points). Filter to one team. |
| `get_playoff_bracket` | Winners/losers bracket with round labels ("Championship", "Semifinal", "Toilet bowl final"), teams and results. |

### Transactions & picks

| Tool | What it returns |
| --- | --- |
| `get_transactions` | Trades, waivers, free-agent moves with players, teams, FAAB bids, traded picks and a per-side `trade_summary`. Current week or `all_weeks`. Failed claims hidden unless `status="failed"`/`"all"`. |
| `get_traded_picks` | All traded picks grouped by current owner with original/previous owners. |

### Drafts

| Tool | What it returns |
| --- | --- |
| `get_drafts` | Drafts for a league or for a user + season. |
| `get_draft` | Draft settings and the resolved draft order (slot → manager → roster). |
| `get_draft_picks` | Every pick with player, position, overall/round pick, drafter, keeper flag, auction price. Filter by round or team. |

### Players

| Tool | What it returns |
| --- | --- |
| `search_players` | Name search (handles "ja marr", "lions") with position/team filters, injury and depth-chart info. |
| `get_player` | Full profile: injury details, practice participation, depth chart, measurables, external IDs, headshot URL. |
| `get_trending_players` | Most added/dropped players platform-wide over the last N hours. |
| `get_free_agents` | Unrostered players in a league ranked by Sleeper's player rank, annotated with 24h trending adds. |

### Projections & stats

| Tool | What it returns |
| --- | --- |
| `get_projections` | Weekly or season (`week=0`) projections. Filter by players/position/league/team. `scoring="league"` applies the league's exact `scoring_settings`. |
| `get_player_stats` | Actual weekly/season fantasy production with the same filters and scoring options. |
| `get_lineup_projections` | Start/sit for one team: current vs optimal lineup (respecting FLEX/SUPER_FLEX/IDP eligibility), suggested swaps, bye/injury/empty-slot warnings. |

### Fantasy intel

Usage from Sleeper's weekly stat rows, injury designations and news from ESPN's public endpoints. Time-sensitive fields (status, news) carry `source` and `as_of`. If ESPN cannot be reached, statuses fall back to Sleeper's and the response says so.

| Tool | What it returns |
| --- | --- |
| `get_lineup_report` | `get_lineup_projections`' output unchanged (the optimal lineup is by projection only), plus for each starter and the 5 highest-projected bench players not on IR or taxi: merged injury status, ESPN player updates from the last 72 hours, usage trend label with played weeks, and `flags` (designation with ESPN's note, ESPN/Sleeper disagreement, no projection, falling usage, bench player out-projecting a starter). Flags come from structured data only. |
| `get_waiver_targets` | `start_now` (free agents projected to beat one of your starters this week), `stash` (largest 3-week projected edge over the starter each would replace), `ir_stash` (injured players for an open IR slot), `drop_candidates` (each with a better replacement, or an IR move) and `bench_watch`. Every pickup has a 3-week projection, a `horizon` for how long it should help, and plain-language `reasons`. |
| `get_injury_report` | Current designations for QB/RB/WR/TE, ESPN's feed merged with Sleeper's. Filter by NFL teams, positions or one league roster. Lists ESPN entries that could not be linked to Sleeper. |
| `get_player_news` | ESPN fantasy updates for chosen players or a roster within `hours` (default 72), separated from multi-player articles that only mention them. |
| `get_player_trends` | Week-by-week snap, target, carry, red zone and air yards share of the team, missed weeks, and a trend label (rising, falling, steady, breakout, insufficient). |
| `get_team_usage` | How one NFL offense splits that volume, with each player's trend, plus volume vacated by injured starters and the teammates in line to absorb it. |

How far to trust `get_waiver_targets`: a replay of the 2025 season ([docs/BACKTEST.md](docs/BACKTEST.md)) found that `start_now` pickups beat the starter they replace but only tie the top-projected free agent at the position, `stash` picks beat the starter they would replace over 3 weeks but trail the top-projected free agent at their own position, drop suggestions are rare and held up, and `ir_stash` adds points in an otherwise empty IR slot. Injury status in the replay was a snap-based stand-in, so injury-driven advice is the least tested.

### Account tools (optional, session)

Registered only when a Sleeper session is configured (`SLEEPER_TOKEN`, or `SLEEPER_EMAIL` + `SLEEPER_PASSWORD`). They talk to Sleeper's **private GraphQL API** (`https://sleeper.com/graphql`), the same one the web app uses. Every tool that changes the account takes `dry_run=true` to validate and preview first, resolves player names for you, and re-reads the roster afterwards so you see the result. "My team" is the roster owned by the logged-in user; pass `roster_id` to act on another one (co-owners/commissioners).

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `get_auth_status` | Who the session belongs to, how it was configured, token expiry, whether writes are enabled. Call it first to verify a token. |
| `get_pending_transactions` | Open trade offers (sent/received, who still has to accept) and pending waiver claims for your team, with names resolved. `all_teams` / `include_finished` widen it. |. Looks at the current and previous week by default, since open claims and offers stay filed under the week they were created in.
| `set_lineup` | Start/bench swaps (`moves: [{start, bench?}]`) or a full `starters` list. Checks slot eligibility (FLEX/SUPER_FLEX/IDP), IR/taxi status and duplicates before sending. |
| `update_ir` | Move players onto/off IR. A starter is benched first so the lineup stays valid; slot counts are enforced. |
| `update_taxi` | Move players onto/off the taxi squad, same guarantees. `force` for commissioner overrides. Note: most leagues block taxi additions once the regular season starts, and Sleeper enforces that server-side. |
| `add_drop_player` | Free-agent add and/or drop, refusing players who are already rostered. |
| `submit_waiver_claim` | Waiver claim with optional drop and FAAB `bid` (required in FAAB leagues, capped at your budget). Sleeper checks roster room at submission time, so a full roster needs a `drop`. |
| `cancel_waiver_claim` | Cancel one of your pending claims. |
| `propose_trade` | Offer players to another manager (`partner` = username, display name, team name or roster_id); `counter_transaction_id` rejects their offer and sends yours in one step. |
| `respond_to_trade` | Accept or reject an offer you received, or cancel one you sent. |
| `post_league_message` | Post in the league chat (e.g. pitch a trade). |

Write tools carry `readOnlyHint: false` so clients can ask for confirmation. Start with `--read-only` to keep the two private reads and drop every write tool even though a session exists.

> **Heads-up:** the private API is undocumented and unsupported by Sleeper; field names and behaviour can change without notice. Use a session you are comfortable exposing to the machine running the server, and confirm each change in the Sleeper app the first few times.

**Getting a token:** log in at [sleeper.com](https://sleeper.com), open DevTools → Network, click any `graphql` request and copy the value of the `authorization` request header (a long `eyJ...` JWT). Set it as `SLEEPER_TOKEN`. Tokens are long-lived but do expire; `get_auth_status` tells you when. Alternatively set `SLEEPER_EMAIL` + `SLEEPER_PASSWORD` and the server logs in on first use (accounts with 2FA/captcha challenges need the token route).

### Prompts

- `weekly_briefing(league_id, username, week?)` — matchup preview, lineup check (`get_lineup_report`), waiver targets (`get_waiver_targets`), league news.
- `waiver_wire_report(league_id, username)` — prioritized claims from `get_waiver_targets`, checked against `get_player_news`, with drops, FAAB suggestions and each pick's horizon.
- `gameday_check(league_id, username)` — starters at risk of sitting (`get_injury_report` + `get_lineup_report`) and the best legal swap for each.
- `trade_analysis(league_id, team_a, team_b, proposal)` — needs, lineup impact, depth, dynasty value, verdict.

### Resources

- `sleeper://nfl/state`
- `sleeper://league/{league_id}`

## Configuration

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SLEEPER_USERNAME` | Your Sleeper username (or user_id). Tools that take a user/team default to it, so "my team" questions need no selector. | unset |
| `SLEEPER_TOKEN` | Sleeper session JWT (see [Account tools](#account-tools-optional-session)). Enables the private reads and the lineup/IR/taxi/waiver/trade/chat tools. | unset (reads only) |
| `SLEEPER_EMAIL`, `SLEEPER_PASSWORD` | Alternative to `SLEEPER_TOKEN`: log in with your Sleeper credentials on first use. | unset |
| `SLEEPER_MCP_READ_ONLY` | `1`/`true` keeps write tools off even when a session is configured (same as `--read-only`). | unset |
| `SLEEPER_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` | If set, HTTP clients must send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Required in HTTP mode when a Sleeper session has writes enabled and the server is not bound to loopback: it refuses to start otherwise. | unset (no auth) |
| `SLEEPER_MCP_INSECURE_NO_AUTH` | Set to `1` to run account write tools on a non-loopback address without a bearer token, for deployments that authenticate in front of the server. | unset |
| `SLEEPER_MCP_CACHE_DIR` | Where the player database is cached on disk. Set to an empty string to disable. | `~/.cache/sleeper-mcp` |
| `PORT`, `HOST` | HTTP bind defaults (`--port`/`--host` override). | `3000`, `0.0.0.0` |

CLI flags: `--http`, `--port <n>`, `--host <addr>`, `--user <name>`, `--read-only`, `--no-preload`, `--help`, `--version`.

## How it works

- **Player database.** Sleeper publishes one ~5 MB JSON of every NFL player. It is downloaded once, indexed for name search, cached in memory and on disk for 24 hours, and preloaded in the background on startup. If a refresh fails, the stale copy is used rather than failing requests.
- **Caching & rate limits.** Every endpoint is cached with a TTL matched to how fast it changes (20 s for live matchups, 5 min for league lists, 24 h for players). Concurrent identical requests are de-duplicated. Outbound calls are capped at 600/min (Sleeper asks for < 1000) and retried with backoff on 429/5xx.
- **Payload design.** Responses use short keys where they repeat hundreds of times (`{id, name, pos, team, inj, pts}`) and drop empty fields, which keeps token usage down for large leagues.
- **Projections/stats.** These use Sleeper's `/projections` and `/stats` endpoints, which power the Sleeper app but are not in the public docs. They have been stable for years; if they change, the rest of the server is unaffected.
- **Usage.** Snap, target, carry, red zone and air yards shares come from `api.sleeper.com/stats` rows, which carry the team a player played for that week. A week counts as played only with an offensive snap.
- **ESPN.** Injury designations and player news come from ESPN's undocumented `site.api.espn.com` endpoints (no key). ESPN ids are linked to Sleeper from ESPN's team rosters by name and team, because Sleeper's `espn_id` is set for only about a quarter of players. Responses are cached (injuries 10 min, news 20 min, rosters 24 h) and requests are capped at 120/min.
- **Backtest.** `scripts/backtest/` replays `get_waiver_targets` over the 2025 season with no live requests after a one-time fetch; results and method are in [docs/BACKTEST.md](docs/BACKTEST.md).
